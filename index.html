    <h2>Location</h2>
      <p>As the smallest country in terms of both land mass and population, Vatican City does not have a capital. The country's coordinates, though, are 41.9029° N, 12.4534° E.
      <br>
      The Vatican is landlocked and completely surrounded by Italy. It is also right next to Rome.
      <br>
      The Vatican City has one timezone, Central European Summer Time. 
        <br>
        The Vatican is typically abbreviated as <strong>VA</strong> or <strong>VAT</strong>.
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Culture</h2>
        The spoken language is Italian, and the practiced religion is Catholicism.
        <br>
        The leader of the Vatican is the pope. The current residing pope is Pope Francis, who has been pope since 2013. He turns 88 this December.
              </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Vatican City is entirely centered around the catholic church.

              <h2>Citizenship</h2>
              <p>No one has actually ever officially been born in Vatican City! There are no hospitals, so you have to apply for citizenship.
              <br>
              Only 5.5% of the population is female.
              <br>
              The population of Vatican City is (as of 2023) <strong>764</strong>. This makes it the smallest country both population <em>AND</em> landmass-wise.
              <br>
              Almost all people granted citizenship work are granted such in order to work with or for the Holy See.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h2>Tourism</h2>
              <p>Almost the entirety of Vatican City is designed for tourists.
              <br>
              It is meant to be the epicenter of the Catholic church, and as so few people live there, most facilities are for tourists or workers of the church.
              <br>
              My personal favorite attraction is the obelisk. It is a large obelisk.</p>

            <p>This is a political map of the Vatican. St. Peter's Square is the big circular plaza, and St. Peter's Basilica is the Church opposite it. It helps show the layout of Vatican City and where various attractions are.</p>
